### What is it?
Bavel offers app developers to implement our button in their app which makes the app member in our network.
From that moment we will send users to your app according to how good it is.<br>

Its the blue button :)

The button from time to time will suggest your users to download apps from our network.

### How much does it cost?
The service is completely free for app developers.

### Can I buy ads from Bavel?
No, our network suggests content based on our algorithms only, which measures our members apps and gives the most relevant and likable app possible each time.

### Do I have to keep any ratio to receive traffic?
No, even if your app doesn't have any users/traffic you will be promoted according to our algorithms assessment only.

### Where do I start? <br>
[Download and install our SDK](/download-and-install)
